## What the hell is all this?
These are the things you have to know:

A "Faucet" is a website that gives you small amounts of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) just for visiting the site and entering a captcha.
This works because the sites are usually filled with more advertisements than you can count.
The amounts you claim per Faucet are usually quite small, but what do you expect for about 10 seconds of work?

A "Cryptorotator" is a software or website, that lists many of these Faucets and gives you an option to easily switch from one to the next.

"Rotator4crypto" is the best of them.
